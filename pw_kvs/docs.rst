``pw_kvs`` is a flash-backed, persistent key-value storage system with
integrated wear leveling and redundancy, targeting NOR flash devices where a
full filesystem is not needed. Key properties include:

- **Wear leveling**: Spreads writes across flash sectors to extend the life of
  the storage medium.
- **Corruption resilience**: Optionally stores multiple copies of each key-value
  entry, spread over flash sectors. ``pw_kvs`` detects corrupted entries on
  read, and can fall back to a previous version of the data.
- **Flexibility**: Supports configuration changes after a product has shipped.
  For example, a firmware update can increase the total size of the KVS or
  increase or decrease the level of redundancy.
- **Simple on-disk format**: Log-structured database where entries are appended
  sequentially. This design has a minimal set of invariants, which simplifies
  implementation and improves robustness against unexpected power loss.
