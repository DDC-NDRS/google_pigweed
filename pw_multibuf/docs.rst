Many forms of device I/O, including sending or receiving messages via RPC,
transfer, or sockets, need to deal with multiple buffers or a series of
intermediate buffers, each requiring their own copy of the data. ``pw_multibuf``
allows data to be written *once*, eliminating the memory, CPU and latency
overhead of copying, and aggregates the memory regions in a manner
that is:

- **Flexible**: Memory regions can be discontiguous and have different ownership
  semantics. Memory regions can be added and removed with few restrictions.
- **Copy-averse**: Users can pass around and mutate MultiBuf instances without
  copying or moving data in-memory.
- **Compact**: The sequence of memory regions and details about them are stored
  in only a few words of additional metadata.

-------------------------------
What kinds of data is this for?
-------------------------------
``pw_multibuf`` is best used in code that wants to read, write, or pass along
data which are one or more of the following:

- **Large**: The MultiBuf type allows breaking up data into multiple chunks.
- **Heterogeneous**: MultiBuf instances allow combining data that is uniquely
  owned, shared, or externally managed, and encapsulates the details of
  deallocating the memory it owns.
- **Latency-sensitive**: Since they are copy-averse, MultiBuf instances are
  useful when working in systems that need to pass large amounts of data, or
  when memory usage is constrained.
- **Discontiguous**: MultiBuf instances provide an interface to accessing and
  modifying memory regions that encapsulates where the memory actually resides.
- **Communications-oriented**: Data which is being received or sent across
  sockets, various packets, or shared-memory protocols can benefit from the
  fragmentation, multiplexing, and layering features of the MultiBuf type.
