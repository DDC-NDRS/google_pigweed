/// RAII helper to use `BasicLockable` locks with thread safety lock annotations
/// with more capabilities than `std::lock_guard`.
///
/// @note The simpler `std::lock_guard` RAII helper is recommended by default
/// due to additional member overhead. `pw::ScopedLocker` should only be used if
/// more complex lock management is required where RAII alone is insufficient.
///
/// Unlike a `std::lock_guard` and `std::scoped_lock`, this helper can be
/// constructed with the lock deferred. In addition, this does not support
/// `std::lock` deadlock avoidance algorithm nor lock adoption from
/// `std::scoped_lock`.
///
/// Lastly this supports explicit `lock()` and `unlock()` like
/// `std::unique_lock`, however unlike `std::unique_lock`, `pw::ScopedLocker`
/// does not support the use of `Lockables`'s conditional lock acquisition,
/// `try_lock()`. This means that this supports thread safety lock annotations
/// unlike `std::unique_lock`.
